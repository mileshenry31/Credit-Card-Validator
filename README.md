# Credit-Card-Validator
This tool validates your credit card number using luhn's algorithm.
There are two ways that I can think of to execute this binary.
1. Git clone this repository, cd into it, and ./ccvalidator
2. The other way is to put it into a folder of binaries and now its executable just by typing in ccvalidator
